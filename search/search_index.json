Development Environment The first thing you need to understand about setting up a ChesslaBlab website in a local development environment is that you have to create an SSL certificate to secure three different domain names at once. chesslablab.org www.chesslablab.org async.chesslablab.org This is because nowadays, major browsers want all traffic to be secure, and as a web developer you want the development environment to mimic production as much as possible. The first two domain names, chesslablab.org and www.chesslablab.org , will point to the IP of the website . When it comes to websites, it is a common practice to create a domain alias that redirects to the primary domain. Hence the two domain names for the website, one starting with www. The async.chesslablab.org to the IP of the asynchronous chess server . Decentralized Environment In a decentralized environment only two domain names need to be secured. chesslablab.org www.chesslablab.org Use custom domain names to configure yours whether you are a chess club, a school, or a FIDE titled player. yourchessclub.com www.yourchessclub.com Free SSL Certificate with Certbot Probably the easiest way to proceed is to purchase a wildcard certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) however you may want to consider to get your free certificate using Certbot instead. Be that as it may, keep in mind that before any CA can issue an SSL certificate, a validation process is required to verify that it can be sent to the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) requester. This is typically achieved through one of the following methods. Email Validation \u2014 a validation email is sent to the certificate requester. HTTP Validation \u2014 the certificate requester is asked to upload a validation file at their host. DNS Validation \u2014 the certificate requester sets up a CNAME record in the domain's DNS zone for further validation. I used Certbot to automatically get a free HTTPS certificate. Since the ChesslaBlab website is running on an Ubuntu server, the certificate was validated through DNS as it is described next. sudo certbot certonly --standalone Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log Please enter the domain name(s) you would like on your certificate (comma and/or space separated) (Enter 'c' to cancel): chesslablab.org www.chesslablab.org async.chesslablab.org Requesting a certificate for chesslablab.org and 2 more domains Successfully received certificate.

These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

Self-Signed SSL Certificate with OpenSSL If issuing a certificate with DNS validation sounds too complicated to you, OpenSSL might be an alternate solution for the development environment. You may want to create a self-signed multi-domain SSL certificate using OpenSSL. openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:foobar -out chesslablab.org.pem 2048 openssl req -passin pass:foobar -new -sha256 -key chesslablab.org.pem -subj \"/C=US/ST=CA/O=ChesslaBlab, Inc./CN=chesslablab.org\" -reqexts SAN -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf \"[SAN]\\nsubjectAltName=DNS:*.mydomain.org\")) -out chesslablab.org.csr openssl x509 -passin pass:foobar -req -days 365 -in chesslablab.org.csr -signkey chesslablab.org.pem -out chesslablab.org.crt openssl rsa -passin pass:foobar -in chesslablab.org.pem -out chesslablab.org.key The command above will generate four files: chesslablab.org.crt chesslablab.org.csr chesslablab.org.key chesslablab.org.pem Then, chesslablab.org.crt and chesslablab.org.key must be renamed in order to match both the certificate and the key filename created by Certbot. As noted before, it is assumed that Certbot is used to automatically generate the HTTPS certificate so all repositories are configured to read these two files on startup. mv chesslablab.org.crt fullchain.pem mv chesslablab.org.key privkey.pem At this point, it is of vital importance to add the chess server's self-signed certificate as trusted to your browser. Figure 1 . Make the browser trust the chess server's self-signed certificate. If skipping this step, the web browser won't be able to connect to the chess server. The latter will complain with an SSL handshake error. SSL handshake error: stream_socket_enable_crypto(): SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages: error:14094416:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert certificate unknown And the web browser will throw an error accordingly. WebSocket connection to 'wss://async.chesslablab.org:8443/' failed Figure 2 . WebSocket connection to 'wss://async.chesslablab.org:8443/' failed. Conclusion In order to set up a local development environment, three different domain names need to be secured at once. The SSL certificate is to be installed in each of the following repositories. chesslablab/website chesslablab/chess-server In a decentralized environment only two domain names need to be secured.

The ChesslaBlab website is a multi-page application (MPA) that is not adhering to the MVC architectural pattern. The controller actions are basically sending an HTML document to the browser on each request. The business logic is implemented in the chess server. In this website architecture in particular, there is no model layer (M) and as a result the Controller layer (C) remains quite basic as in the following example. The main reason behind a multi-page architecture like this one as opposed to a single-page architecture is that we want the pages to be indexed by web crawlers. <?php namespace App\\Controller\\Pages\\Play; use Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\AbstractController; use Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Response; class ComputerController extends AbstractController { public function index(): Response { return $this->render('pages/play/computer/index.html.twig'); } } As a rule of thumb, there is a .twig.html file and a .js file associated to each controller action.
