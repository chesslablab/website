The Nimzo-Indian Defense is a popular response to White's d4. The Sämisch Variation is a good choice, and more specifically, this is the Keres Variation.

Also chess games can be embedded in Recursive Annotation Variation (RAV) format. This is an extension of the Standard Algebaric Notation (SAN) format that allows to annotate chess variations. It is especially useful for tutorials, notable games, chess studies and so on.
